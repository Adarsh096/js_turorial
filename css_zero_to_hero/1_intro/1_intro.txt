=> To test the link of css with html pages just create a simple background style for body content and just open the index.html
sample css can be :
    body{
        background: red;
    }

=> selectors are used to apply styling to particular section of html.
    It can be the name of the tag and {} 
    Eg :
        p{
        }
    Eg:
        h2{
        }
=> we can select all documents with same class tags like :
    Syntax : 
        .anyClass{
        }
    
=> we can select by id  like following:
    Syntax:
        #anyID{
        }
